#Featured Stories
Survivors can directly input their own story into this 60's Scoop platform. You will have the option to share as little or as much information about yourself as you want; this can include short videos, pictures and a short narrative about themselves. The mapping project is completely voluntary and participatory. Below are several examples of survivors stories, click on any of the cards to access more information about them.
